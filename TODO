Catapult PHP SDK TODO list
===========================================================

This is an active list of features Catapult may or may not
add to its PHP code. You are free to commit to these
changes by following the GitHub repository.

Each item is rated by its priority level

- consider using (array) casting in place
of built in Converter::toArray. Benchmark results
in demos.

to add:
(array)$json
current:
Converter::toArray($json)

- add 0.5.0 features backwards compatability. '_' functions
can be easily mocked by recalling the GenericResource's

__call function. 


- remove Cleaner in event objects

- more documentation

- Statuses and eventTypes need more constants
as when they are left untreated they are hard to
debug

current:
"inter-digit-timeout" 

should be rendered as:
GATHER_REASONS::interDigitTimeout

or

CONFERENCE_MEMBER_STATE::done

- states need to checked agaisnt lowercase. 
- maybe add support for 0.5.0 underscored
functions. Note: functions can be mocked using GenericResource's
init. get_transcriptions becomes getTranscriptions

Collections need iterator, using page and size options [x]
Client object needs to be renamed in preventing conflicts [x]

Media Object
get/1 needs to be replaced by the content setting

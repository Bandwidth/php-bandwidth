Catapult PHP SDK TODO list
===========================================================

This is an active list of features Catapult may or may not
add to its PHP code. You are free to commit to these
changes by following the GitHub repository.

- consider using (array) casting in place
of built in Converter::toArray. Benchmark results
in demos.

to add:
(array)$json
current:
Converter::toArray($json)

- maybe add support for 0.5.0 underscored
functions. Note: functions can be mocked using GenericResource's
init. get_transcriptions becomes getTranscriptions

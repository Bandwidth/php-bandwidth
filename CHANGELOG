Old CHANGELOG was erased. If you have a version, please report it to me
at: matrix.nad@gmail.com

Continuing from 0.5.0

0.5.0
-----------------------------------------------------
- Added logging support
  Catapult\Log. Static class used with
  all exception handling. Provides information of
  the error line, time and application id. Logs
  are generated in ./logs of the working directory. 
  Individual files are prefixed (changable) with 'catapult_'

- Fixes to match PHP standards, omit warnings.
  Catapult uses reporting mode ERROR_STRICT ^ CRITICAL.
  this is only visible in the API and not externally. I.e scripts
  using it.

0.5.1
---------------------------------------------------

- Full SSL support in RESTful client. Ability to use
  identity keys when authenticating with Catapult. Usage:
  BEFORE initiating a client object:

  Catapult\RESTClient::sslKey("mykey.pem");

  fully turning ssl checks off (not recommended, only do if unable to sign certificate):
  Catapult\RESTClient::verify(FALSE);

- Fixes to log for Windows, Local machine setup fixes, with CURL
